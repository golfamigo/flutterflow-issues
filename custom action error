The custom action I previously created has been consistently showing the message 
"Unknown error compiling custom code. A common cause is a custom widget or action whose name in the code does not match the name provided in the editor." 
after today's FlutterFlow update. Regardless of how many times I compile, the issue remains. Everything was working fine before the update.

The custom code is:

import 'dart:core';

double? caculatePrice(List<double> usage, List<double> price, int cartWeight) {
  double sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < usage.length; i++) {
    double multipliedValue = usage[i] * price[i] * cartWeight / 100000;
    multipliedValue = multipliedValue.roundToDouble();
    sum = sum + multipliedValue;
  }

  return sum;
}

action Name: caculatePrice
